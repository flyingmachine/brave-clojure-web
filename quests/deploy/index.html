        <h1>Easily Deploy Your Clojure Web Site</h1>
        <div class="hype">
          
          <p>
            Do you want to put a Clojure web app in front of people's
            faces? Are you thwarted by the tedium involved in setting
            up and deploying to your own server?
            <em>Deploying Your First Clojure App ...From the Shadows</em>
            shows you how to <strong>use scripts to deploy your app to
            a real server using only a few commands!</strong> 
          </p>
          <p>
            I've written a bunch of Ansible scripts to make Clojure
            deployment as easy as possible, and this guide explains
            how to use them (and what Ansible is). Along the way,
            you'll learn a bit about DevOps and production
            Clojure. You might even learn a little about yourself?!?
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't worry if you've never set up a web server in your
            life. I wrote this guide so that it'd be accessible even
            if you have no experience! <strong>I want everyone to be
            able to share their cool Clojure projects with the
            world!</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            (Disclaimer: This book does not cover how to actually
            build a Clojure web site! Check
            out <a href="http://www.luminusweb.net/docs">Luminus</a>
            for that.)

          <h1>A Brave Clojure Quest</h1>
          <p>
            <em>Clojure for the Brave and True</em> was a blast to
            write, and there's so much more Clojure goodness to write
            about. That's where Brave Clojure Quests come in.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Deploying Your First Clojure App ...From the
            Shadows</em> is the first Quest I've completed. The
            next, <em>The Palmco Employee Guide to Parallel
            Programming with Reducers</em>, is almost ready to be
            released, and I'd really appreciate it if you helped me
            complete it!
          </p>
          <p>
            If you'd like to support my efforts to create free,
            high-quality Clojure guides, then please consider buying
            the PDF, mobi, and epub ebooks:
